# Hugo Goldmark Extensions

[![Tests on Linux, MacOS and Windows](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo-goldmark-extensions/workflows/Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo-goldmark-extensions/actions?query=workflow:Test)

This repository houses a collection of [Goldmark] extensions created by the [Hugo] community, focusing on expanding Hugo's markdown functionality.

[CommonMark]: https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/
[Goldmark]: https://github.com/yuin/goldmark/
[Hugo]: https://gohugo.io/
[LaTeX]: https://www.latex-project.org/about/
[KaTeX]: https://katex.org/

## Passthrough extension

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/gohugoio/hugo-goldmark-extensions/passthrough?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/gohugoio/hugo-goldmark-extensions/passthrough)

Use this extension to preserve raw Markdown within delimited snippets of text. This was initially developed to support [LaTeX] mixed with Markdown, specifically mathematical expressions and equations.

For example, to preserve raw Markdown for inline snippets delimited by the `$` character:

Markdown|Default rendering|Passthrough rendering
:--|:--|:--
`a $_text_$ snippet`|`a $<em>text</em>$ snippet`|`a $_text_$ snippet`

In the Markdown example above, the underscores surrounding the word "text" signify emphasis. The Markdown renderer wraps the word within `em` tags as required by the [CommonMark] specification. In comparison, the passthrough extension preserves the text within and including the delimiters.

Why is this important? Consider this example of a mathematical equation written in LaTeX:

Markdown|Default rendering|Passthrough rendering
:--|:--|:--
`$a^*=x-b^*$`|`$a^<em>=x-b^</em>$`|`$a^*=x-b^*$`

Without this extension, LaTeX parsers such as [KaTeX] and [MathJax] will render this:

\$a^<em>=x-b^</em>\$

Instead of this:

$a^\*=x-b^\*$

### Delimiters

There are two types of delimiters:

- Text within and including _inline_ delimiters is rendered inline with the surrounding text.
- Text within and including _block_ delimiters is rendered between adjacent block elements.

As shown below, delimiters are defined in pairs of opening and closing characters.

### Usage

```go
package main

import (
	"bytes"
	"fmt"

	"github.com/gohugoio/hugo-goldmark-extensions/passthrough"
	"github.com/yuin/goldmark"
)

func main() {
	md := goldmark.New(
		goldmark.WithExtensions(
			passthrough.New(
				passthrough.Config{
					InlineDelimiters: []passthrough.Delimiters{
						{
							Open:  "$",
							Close: "$",
						},
						{
							Open:  "\\(",
							Close: "\\)",
						},
					},
					BlockDelimiters: []passthrough.Delimiters{
						{
							Open:  "$$",
							Close: "$$",
						},
						{
							Open:  "\\[",
							Close: "\\]",
						},
					},
				},
			)),
	)

	input := `
block $$a^*=x-b^*$$ snippet

inline $a^*=x-b^*$ snippet
`

	var buf bytes.Buffer
	if err := md.Convert([]byte(input), &buf); err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	fmt.Println(buf.String())
}
```
